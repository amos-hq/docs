AMOS is infrastructure-agnostic and can run wherever your compliance or strategy requires.

## Overview

<Card>
| Model | Typical context | Characteristics |
|-------|------------------|-----------------|
| **Cloud-native** | Modern data stack (Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift) | Fastest implementation, managed scaling |
| **Hybrid** | Sensitive data stays on-prem | Compute in cloud, custody stays internal |
| **Fully self-hosted** | Regulated or private infrastructure mandates | Full control over infra, connectivity, and security posture |
</Card>

## Pros & Cons

Each approach provides the same core functionality with different infrastructure and control models.
