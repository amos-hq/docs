title: "Implementation Process"

AMOS can be implemented entirely by internal IT or data teams. However, you may also choose to involve the AMOS team to accelerate adoption and ensure that change management and governance land correctly from the start.

What follows describes the **standard AMOS-led implementation path**, designed to deliver value quickly while minimizing disruption.


## Phase 1 — Strategic Framing (1-day workshop)

A focused working session with fund leadership to define:
- Current pain points and bottlenecks
- What “good” looks like — reporting speed, governance, audit posture, operating model
- Scope and success criteria for an initial pilot

<Check>Output: **agreed problem definition, architecture direction, and adoption success metrics**</Check>



## Phase 2 — Audit & Architecture Validation

AMOS conducts a structured review of:
- Existing systems, data sources, and data quality
- Reconciliation practices and constraints
- Security, compliance, and infrastructure requirements

<Check>Output: **validated integration architecture + deployment strategy**</Check>



## Phase 3 — First Pilot (live, narrow, high-value use case)

One concrete workflow is implemented end-to-end — e.g. quarterly reporting pack, exposure monitoring, or deal pipeline visibility.

- No system replacement
- Runs in parallel to existing process
- Designed to prove value unambiguously

<Check>Output: **live result, visible to business stakeholders — not a technical demo**</Check>



## Phase 4 — Progressive Expansion

Once the pilot is validated:
- Additional systems are connected
- Broader workflows are migrated
- Governance and adoption routines are formalized (ownership, SLAs, change control)

The rollout is **incremental, never a “big bang.”**

<Check>Output: **full data platform**</Check>



At every stage, AMOS remains infrastructure-portable and fully reversible. No lock-in is ever created.
