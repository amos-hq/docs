# Implementation Overview

## Implementation Philosophy

Amos implementations follow a structured, phased approach designed to minimize operational disruption while delivering value quickly. Our methodology emphasizes early wins, stakeholder engagement, and continuous optimization.

## Project Phases

### Phase 1: Assessment & Planning (2-4 weeks)

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Mitigation Strategies
- Comprehensive pre-implementation assessment
- Phased rollout with pilot testing
- Extensive user training and support
- Continuous monitoring and optimization

## Timeline Expectations

<Note>
Implementation timelines vary based on fund size, system complexity, and deployment model. Most implementations complete within 3-6 months from project initiation.
</Note>

### Typical Timeline Ranges
- **Small Funds (< $500M AUM)**: 8-16 weeks
- **Mid-Market Funds ($500M - $2B AUM)**: 12-20 weeks
- **Large Funds (> $2B AUM)**: 16-24 weeks

## Project Governance

### Steering Committee
- Executive sponsor and key stakeholders
- Regular progress reviews and decision-making
- Issue escalation and resolution

### Working Groups
- Technical integration team
- Business process and user experience team
- Training and change management team
