    - Plan for scalability demonstration within pilot scope
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Resource Constraints">
    **Risk**: Key stakeholders unavailable during pilot period
    
    **Mitigation**:
    - Secure formal commitment from pilot participants
    - Build buffer time into pilot schedule
    - Identify backup resources for critical roles
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Technical Challenges">
    **Risk**: Unexpected integration complexity delays pilot
    
    **Mitigation**:
    - Conduct thorough technical assessment before pilot start
    - Start with most reliable data sources
