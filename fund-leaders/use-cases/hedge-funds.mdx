## Scenario 1: Real-Time Risk Management & Monitoring

### The Challenge
A multi-strategy hedge fund with $3B AUM was struggling with fragmented risk systems across equity long/short, fixed income, and derivatives strategies. Risk calculations were performed end-of-day, limiting the ability to respond to intraday market movements and regulatory requirements for real-time monitoring.

### Amos Solution Implementation

#### Adapt Phase: Integrate Risk Data Sources

## Scenario 2: Performance Attribution & Analytics

### The Challenge
A quantitative hedge fund needed precise performance attribution across 15+ strategies with daily investor reporting requirements. Manual reconciliation between portfolio systems and prime brokers was taking 2-3 hours daily and creating accuracy issues.

### Amos Solution: Automated Performance Engine
