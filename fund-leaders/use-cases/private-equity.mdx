## Scenario 1: Deal Sourcing & Due Diligence Automation

### The Challenge
A mid-market PE fund was spending 40+ hours per week manually tracking deal flow from investment banks, proprietary sources, and referral networks. Due diligence required coordinating data requests across legal, financial, and operational workstreams with limited visibility into process status.

## Scenario 2: Portfolio Company Performance Monitoring

### The Challenge
A growth equity fund with 25 portfolio companies struggled to maintain consistent KPI tracking across investments. Monthly board packages required manual data collection from each company, often resulting in delayed or incomplete reporting.

### Amos Solution Implementation

- **Data Collection**: Monthly emails requesting updates from portfolio companies
- **Consolidation**: Manual Excel compilation with inconsistent formats
- **Analysis**: Limited benchmarking and trend analysis capabilities
- **Reporting**: 2-3 weeks to produce portfolio summary reports

#### Amos Transformation: Automated Portfolio Intelligence

## Scenario 3: LP Reporting & Investor Relations
