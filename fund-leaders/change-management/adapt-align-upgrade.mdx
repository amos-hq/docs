description: "Detailed guide to the three-phase transformation approach that minimizes risk while maximizing adoption success"
---

## Methodology Overview

The Adapt → Align → Upgrade methodology is specifically designed for fund operations where disruption to critical processes can have significant business impact. This approach ensures continuous operation while systematically transforming your data capabilities.

<Card title="Why This Approach Works for Funds" icon="lightbulb">
Fund operations require precision, compliance, and reliability. Traditional "big bang" implementations risk disrupting investor reporting, regulatory compliance, and deal processes. Our phased approach maintains operational continuity while building organizational confidence and capability.
