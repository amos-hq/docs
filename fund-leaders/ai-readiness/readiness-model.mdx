# AI Readiness Model

Most funds exist somewhere on a spectrum from completely fragmented data operations to AI-ready unified platforms. Understanding where you currently standâ€”and what capabilities you need to developâ€”is essential for planning successful AI initiatives.

Our AI Readiness Model defines four distinct levels (L0-L3) that represent the progression from data chaos to AI enablement. Each level builds on the previous one, creating a clear roadmap for transformation.

## The Four Levels of AI Readiness

### Level 0: Fragmented Data (Most Funds Start Here)

<Card title="L0: Fragmented Data" icon="ðŸ”´">
**Characteristics**: Data scattered across multiple systems with manual processes, inconsistent definitions, and limited integration.

**Typical State**: Fund admin data in one system, portfolio tracking in spreadsheets, CRM in another tool, with manual reporting processes.

**AI Capability**: None. Data quality and accessibility issues prevent any reliable AI implementation.
</Card>

**Common Challenges at L0:**
- Investment data exists in fund administration systems but isn't easily accessible
- Portfolio company information lives in spreadsheets with inconsistent formats
- Market data comes from multiple vendors with different schemas
- Reporting requires manual data gathering from multiple sources
- No single source of truth for key metrics like IRR, MOIC, or portfolio valuations

**Business Impact:**
- Reporting cycles take weeks instead of days
- Investment decisions based on incomplete or outdated information
- Compliance reporting requires significant manual effort
- Limited ability to identify portfolio-wide trends or risks

### Level 1: Consolidated Data

<Card title="L1: Consolidated Data" icon="ðŸŸ¡">
**Characteristics**: Data from multiple sources brought together in a unified platform with basic standardization and quality controls.

**Typical State**: Amos ingesting data from fund admin, portfolio systems, and market data with initial data models implemented.

**AI Capability**: Basic analytics and reporting, simple predictive models for well-defined use cases.
</Card>

**Key Capabilities at L1:**
- Automated data ingestion from primary fund systems
- Standardized data models for core entities (funds, investments, investors)
- Basic data quality monitoring and validation
- Unified reporting across all data sources
- Historical data preservation and accessibility

**Progression Requirements:**
- Implement Amos core data platform
- Connect primary data sources (fund admin, portfolio management)
- Establish basic data governance policies
- Train team on unified data access patterns

**Timeline**: Typically 3-6 months from L0

### Level 2: Governed Data

<Card title="L2: Governed Data" icon="ðŸŸ ">
**Characteristics**: Comprehensive data governance with role-based access, audit trails, and business-ready data models that support advanced analytics.

**Typical State**: Full data lineage tracking, automated quality monitoring, and business users able to self-serve analytics needs.

**AI Capability**: Production-ready AI for specific use cases like portfolio risk assessment, investor reporting automation, and basic due diligence support.
</Card>

**Key Capabilities at L2:**
- Complete data lineage from source systems to business reports
- Role-based access controls aligned with fund compliance requirements
- Automated data quality monitoring with alerting
- Business-friendly data models that non-technical users can query

- Develop data quality monitoring and alerting systems

**Timeline**: Typically 6-12 months from L1

### Level 3: AI-Ready Feature Stores

<Card title="L3: AI-Ready Feature Stores" icon="ðŸŸ¢">
**Characteristics**: Purpose-built feature engineering and model serving infrastructure that enables sophisticated AI applications across fund operations.

**Typical State**: Real-time feature serving, A/B testing frameworks, and production AI systems supporting investment decisions and operational efficiency.

**AI Capability**: Advanced AI applications including predictive due diligence, automated portfolio optimization, intelligent investor communications, and real-time risk monitoring.
</Card>

**Key Capabilities at L3:**
- Real-time feature engineering and serving for AI models
- A/B testing frameworks for AI-driven decision support
- Model monitoring and performance tracking infrastructure
- Automated model retraining and deployment pipelines
