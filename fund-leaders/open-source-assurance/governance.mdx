## Enterprise-Grade Governance for Open Source

Open source doesn't mean ungoverned. Amos provides enterprise-grade governance frameworks that exceed traditional vendor capabilities while maintaining the flexibility and transparency that open source enables.

**Every change is controlled, every access is monitored, and every process is auditable.**

## Change Management via Pull Requests

### Git-Based Change Control

All system changes flow through a structured pull request (PR) process that provides complete governance and audit trails:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Developer/Analyst] --> B[Create Feature Branch]
    B --> C[Make Changes]
    C --> D[Automated Testing]
    D --> E{Tests Pass?}
    E -->|No| F[Fix Issues]
    F --> C
    E -->|Yes| G[Create Pull Request]
    G --> H[Code Review]
    H --> I[Security Scan]
    I --> J[Compliance Check]
    J --> K{Approved?}
    K -->|No| L[Address Feedback]
    L --> H
    K -->|Yes| M[Merge to Main]
    M --> N[Deploy to Production]
    N --> O[Audit Log Entry]
    
    style A fill:#e3f2fd
    style G fill:#fff3e0
    style M fill:#e8f5e8
    style O fill:#fce4ec
```

### Multi-Level Approval Workflows

Different types of changes require different approval levels:

| Change Type | Required Approvals | Example |
|-------------|-------------------|---------|
| **Configuration Updates** | 1 Senior Analyst + 1 Operations | Data source connection strings |
| **Business Logic Changes** | 1 Portfolio Manager + 1 Compliance | NAV calculation modifications |
| **Security Changes** | 1 CISO + 1 CTO | Access control modifications |
| **Infrastructure Changes** | 1 DevOps Lead + 1 CTO | Deployment configuration updates |

### Automated Governance Checks

Every pull request triggers automated governance validation:

```yaml
# Example: Automated governance pipeline
governance_pipeline:
  security_scan:
    - secret_detection
    - vulnerability_scanning
    - license_compliance
    
  compliance_checks:
    - pii_data_handling
    - data_retention_policies
    - access_control_validation
    
  business_validation:
    - calculation_accuracy_tests
    - data_quality_validation
    - performance_impact_assessment
    
  documentation_requirements:
    - change_description_required
    - business_justification_required
    - rollback_plan_documented
```

## Least-Privilege Access Model

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

Amos implements comprehensive RBAC aligned with fund organizational structures:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Executive Access" icon="user-check">
    Read-only access to executive dashboards and summary reports with full audit logging.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Portfolio Management" icon="chart-line">
    Access to investment data, performance analytics, and portfolio reporting with change approval rights.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Operations Team" icon="cog">
    System configuration access with mandatory peer review and compliance validation.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Compliance Team" icon="shield-check">
    Audit access to all systems with read-only permissions and comprehensive logging.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Dynamic Access Controls

Access permissions are dynamically managed based on context and risk:

```yaml
# Example: Dynamic access policy
access_policy:
  user: "portfolio.analyst@fund.com"
  base_permissions:
    - read_portfolio_data
    - create_analysis_reports
    
  conditional_permissions:
    - permission: "modify_nav_calculations"
      conditions:
        - time_window: "business_hours"
        - approval_required: true
        - dual_control: true
        
    - permission: "access_investor_pii"
      conditions:
        - business_justification: required
        - time_limited: "4_hours"
        - audit_notification: "compliance_team"
```

### Identity Integration

Seamless integration with existing identity management systems:

- **Active Directory/LDAP**: Automatic user provisioning and group synchronization
- **SAML/OIDC**: Single sign-on with multi-factor authentication
- **Privileged Access Management**: Integration with PAM solutions for elevated access
- **Just-in-Time Access**: Temporary elevated permissions with automatic expiration

```yaml
# Example: Security monitoring configuration
security_monitoring:
  threat_detection:
    - unusual_access_patterns
    - privilege_escalation_attempts
    - data_exfiltration_indicators
    - configuration_drift_detection
    
  automated_response:
    - account_lockout_on_suspicious_activity
    - network_isolation_on_threat_detection
    - incident_escalation_to_security_team
    - evidence_preservation_for_investigation
    
  compliance_monitoring:
    - access_control_violations
    - data_handling_policy_violations
    - change_management_bypasses
    - audit_log_integrity_checks
```

    style K fill:#f44336
```

## Compliance Automation

### Automated Compliance Reporting

Amos automatically generates compliance reports and evidence:

```python
# Example: Automated compliance report generation
def generate_compliance_report(period, framework):
    """Generate compliance evidence package"""
    
    evidence = {
        'access_controls': collect_access_evidence(period),
        'change_management': collect_change_evidence(period),
        'data_processing': collect_processing_evidence(period),
        'security_controls': collect_security_evidence(period),
        'audit_trails': collect_audit_evidence(period)
    }
    
    report = ComplianceReport(
        framework=framework,  # SOC2, ISO27001, etc.
        period=period,
        evidence=evidence,
        attestations=collect_attestations()
    )
    
    return report.generate_package()
```

### Continuous Compliance Monitoring

Real-time compliance posture monitoring:

| Compliance Area | Monitoring Frequency | Alert Threshold | Remediation SLA |
|-----------------|---------------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| **Access Controls** | Real-time | Any violation | 15 minutes |
| **Data Quality** | Every pipeline run | >1% degradation | 1 hour |
| **Change Management** | Every commit | Unapproved changes | Immediate |
| **Security Controls** | Continuous | Any security event | 5 minutes |
